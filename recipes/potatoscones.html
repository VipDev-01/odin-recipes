        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Tattie scones are similar to potato pancakes. From an Irish and Scottish background, these scones are the perfect side with any breakfast meal and are a family favorite! Add onion, pepper, or any other spices for flavor. Serve with butter. Enjoy.</p>

            <li>4 ounces self-rising fluor</li>
            <li>2 ounces butter</li>
            <li>1/2 pinch salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>

            <li>Heat a lightly greased griddle or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Mash potatoes with flour, butter, and salt in a large bowl until a stiff dough forms.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead dough lightly and roll dough out to a 1/2-inch-thick circle. Cut into 6 equal wedges.
