        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This colcannon recipe uses leeks and green cabbage but it tastes equally delicious with kale. It is traditional Irish Halloween fare but so comforting, it's good anytime!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound potatoes</li>
            <li>1 pound green cabbage, sliced</li>
            <li>2 small leeks, cleaned and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup milk, or as needed</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground mace</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>While potatoes are boiling, simmer or steam cabbage in a separate pot until tender. Drain and chop; set aside and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Place leeks in a small pot; add just enough milk to cover. Simmer over low heat until leeks are soft, about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season potatoes with salt, pepper, and mace; mash well. Stir in cooked leeks and milk. Stir in cabbage and heat through until potatoes are pale green in color. Make a well in the center of the colcannon and pour in the melted butter. Mix well and serve.</li>
        </ol>
